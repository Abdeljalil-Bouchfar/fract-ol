## What are Fractals
  A fractal is a never-ending pattern that repeats itself at different scales, this property is called `self-similarity`, although fractals are very complex, they are made by repeating a simple operation driven by recursion.
## Fractals are everywhere
  In fact, nature is full of fractals. For instance trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes:

  And there is Abstract fractals â€“ such as the Mandelbrot Set â€“ can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over:
